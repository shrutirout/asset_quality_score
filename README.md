#### 📜 Project Goal
This project aims to enhance the lending decision process by implementing data-driven asset quality scoring using machine learning. We develop an ML model for 'Asset Quality Scoring' that predicts default risk based on historical loan performance data from LendingClub, enabling transparent and explainable loan approval decisions. The model incorporates explainability features using SHAP and LIME to provide transparent justifications for predicted scores, supporting banks in minimizing risk while maintaining regulatory compliance and fair lending practices.

#### 🎯 Methodology & Approach
* Phase 1: Comprehensive Data Understanding
We began with extensive exploratory data analysis on the LendingClub dataset (2.26M records, 145+ features) to understand loan performance patterns, default distributions, and feature relationships. This foundation was critical given the highly imbalanced nature of the data (86.86% good loans vs. 13.14% defaults), which required specialized handling throughout the pipeline.

* Phase 2: Strategic Feature Engineering
Rather than relying solely on raw features, we engineered domain-specific financial ratios and risk indicators (payment_burden, utilization_ratio, delinquency_score) that better capture borrower risk profiles. We implemented a dual outlier treatment strategy - preserving risk-informative outliers while normalizing distributions in low-impact features.

* Phase 3: Multi-Model Evaluation Framework
We trained and compared 9 different algorithms across traditional ML, ensemble methods, and deep learning to identify the optimal approach. This included handling class imbalance through SMOTE for distance-based algorithms and careful scaling for neural networks.

* Phase 4: Probability-Based Scoring Paradigm
Initially, we attempted manual asset quality calculation using weighted financial ratios, but this approach failed to adequately distinguish risk levels since many poor-quality loans still didn't default. We pivoted to a probability-based approach, using calibrated default probabilities from one of our best-performing models (XGBoost) to derive asset quality scores. This ensured scores aligned with actual default likelihood, maximizing bank loss prevention.

* Phase 5: Model Calibration & Interpretability
We addressed model confidence issues through Isotonic Regression calibration and implemented decile binning for business-friendly scoring (1-10 scale with letter grades). SHAP and LIME explainability tools were integrated to provide transparent, feature-level justifications for individual predictions.

This methodology ensures our asset quality scores are not only statistically robust but also practically useful for lending decisions and regulatory compliance.

#### 📊 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

#### ✅ Dataset Overview:
* Source: Lending Club loan dataset
* Target Variable: `loan_status` converted to `loan_status_binary`
  * `0`: Good loans (Fully Paid, Current)
  * `1`: Bad loans (Defaulted, Charged Off, etc.)

#### ✅ Column Pruning:
* Removed 40+ irrelevant or non-impactful columns like `id`, `url`, `next_pymnt_d`, hardship-related fields, etc.

#### ✅ Target Variable Summary:
* Good Loans: \~86.86%
* Bad Loans (Defaults): \~13.14%

#### ✅ Missing Value Analysis:
* Performed detailed analysis by missingness level:
  * **High Missingness (>30%)**: Dropped columns.
  * **Moderate**: Filled with median.
  * **Low**: Median/zero/mode fill.
  * **Very Low**: Custom fill based on semantics.

#### ✅ Feature Engineering & Cleaning:
* Converted `term` to numeric
* Mapped `grade` and `sub_grade` to ordinal values
* Cleaned `emp_length`, converted to numeric
* Parsed `issue_d` and `earliest_cr_line`, created `credit_history_length`

#### ✅ Output:
* Final preprocessed file saved as: `Preprocessing_Loan_CSV.csv`

### 🔍 2. Feature Analysis & Selection

#### ✅ Numerical Features:

* Initially **63 numerical columns** were identified.
* Correlation with the target variable (`loan_status_binary`) was calculated.
* Low-correlation features (correlation < `0.01`) were removed, such as:
  * `emp_length`, `chargeoff_within_12_mths`, `tot_coll_amt`, `delinq_amnt`.
  * At the end, **59 numerical features** were retained.

#### ✅ Statistical Analysis:

* Summary statistics (`mean`, `std`, percentiles, `skew`, `kurtosis`) were generated to evaluate distribution characteristics.
* Useful for identifying skewed or heavy-tailed variables that may benefit from transformation.

#### ✅ Categorical Feature Encoding:
* The number of categorical features recognized was 10.
* Initial categorical features: `home_ownership`, `verification_status`, `issue_d`, `loan_status`, `purpose`, `zip_code`, `addr_state`, `earliest_cr_line`, `initial_list_status`, `application_type`.
* Removed irrelevant or high-cardinality columns: `zip_code`, `issue_d`, `loan_status`, `earliest_cr_line`.
* Remaining categorical columns (`addr_state`, `purpose`, etc.) were **label encoded** using `LabelEncoder`.

#### 📊 Visualization
To better understand the behavior of defaulted and non-defaulted loans, we performed extensive visual exploration of key features. The goal was to identify trends, outliers, and variables with strong predictive power for asset quality modeling.

#### 📌 Correlation Heatmap of Top Features
The most insightful visualization was a **correlation heatmap** capturing the relationships between the top 20 numerical features and the binary target variable `loan_status_binary`.

**Key Observations:**
* **Top Correlated Predictors of Default:**
  * `sub_grade`, `grade`, and `int_rate` exhibited the highest positive correlation (\~0.21–0.23) with default probability, making them strong risk indicators.
  * `total_rec_prncp` and `last_pymnt_amnt` were negatively correlated, suggesting that higher repayment amounts reduce default likelihood.

* **Multicollinearity:**
  * `sub_grade`, `grade`, and `int_rate` are highly collinear, which is expected since they reflect creditworthiness tiers.
  * A cluster of credit-limit related features (`total_bc_limit`, `tot_hi_cred_lim`, `avg_cur_bal`) showed strong internal correlation, emphasizing redundancy among financial strength indicators.

* **Feature Pruning Strategy:**
  * Features with near-zero correlation to the target or high redundancy were dropped to reduce noise and improve model efficiency.

#### 📉 Other Key Visualizations (Explored During EDA)

* Interest Rate Analysis
* Loan Amount & Installments
* Loan Term
* Borrower Behavior & Credit History
* Repayment Features
* Demographics & Income

## 🔎 Outlier Detection & Treatment

* **13 key features** were analyzed for outliers, including:
  * `loan_amnt`, `annual_inc`, `dti`, `int_rate`, `installment`
  * Utilization metrics: `revol_util`, `revol_bal`, `bc_util`
  * Credit limits and account metrics: `total_acc`, `open_acc`, `avg_cur_bal`, `tot_hi_cred_lim`, `total_bc_limit`

* Features with the **highest proportion of outliers**:

  | Feature          | % Outliers |
  | ---------------- | ---------- |
  | `revol_bal`      | 6.06%      |
  | `total_bc_limit` | 6.04%      |
  | `avg_cur_bal`    | 5.67%      |
  | `annual_inc`     | 4.87%      |

* **Impact on Default Rate:**

  * Outliers in `int_rate`, `revol_util`, and `bc_util` showed a **massive increase** in default rate (↑ \~16.2%)
  * Others like `loan_amnt`, `annual_inc` had lower or inverse impacts

### ✅ Outlier Treatment Strategy

| Risk Level    | Feature Examples                                      | Strategy                                  |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **High-risk** | `int_rate`, `revol_util`, `bc_util`, `dti`            | Capped at IQR bounds (preserve risk info) |
| **Low-risk**  | `loan_amnt`, `annual_inc`, `total_acc`, `avg_cur_bal` | Winsorized at 1st–99th percentiles        |

This dual strategy allowed us to retain useful risk-related outliers while normalizing long-tail distributions in low-impact features.

## 🛠️ Feature Engineering

To enhance model expressiveness, several **domain-specific features** were engineered using financial ratios and borrower behavior patterns:

| Feature Name           | Description                                                             |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `payment_burden`       | Installment-to-monthly-income ratio                                     |
| `loan_income_ratio`    | Loan amount relative to annual income                                   |
| `utilization_ratio`    | Revolving balance to credit limit usage                                 |
| `active_account_ratio` | Proportion of active open accounts                                      |
| `risk_flag_count`      | Count of borrower red flags (high DTI, delinquencies, high utilization) |
| `delinquency_score`    | Aggregated delinquency and public record risk                           |
| `credit_quality`       | Score inversely related to credit grade                                 |

After preprocessing, the dataset had:

* ✅ **2.26 million records**
* ✅ **74 total features** (post-engineering and capping)

#### ✅ Final Outcome:

* Cleaned and encoded feature set ready for modeling.
* The output DataFrame includes **clean, normalized, robust numerical and encoded categorical variables** correlated with the target.
* Ensures the model trains on the most informative features only.
* Final processed file saved as: `processed_loan_csv.csv`

### ✅ Final Model Selection: **XGBoost**

Although the **TensorFlow model** demonstrated slightly higher recall and F1 scores, we ultimately selected **XGBoost** for final deployment due to a combination of practical, interpretability, and scoring reasons:
* **Interpretability**:
  XGBoost is inherently more interpretable compared to deep learning. It seamlessly integrates with tools like **SHAP** and **LIME**, allowing us to explain **why a loan was marked risky** — a crucial requirement for lending systems.
* **Probability-Based Scoring**:
  XGBoost’s `.predict_proba()` method produces **well-calibrated default probabilities** which we used to derive **asset quality scores** on a 0–100 scale. These scores aligned meaningfully with observed default densities.
* **Calibration Compatibility**:
  XGBoost responds well to **probability calibration techniques** like **Isotonic Regression** and **Platt Scaling**, improving the reliability of score-based thresholds (e.g., score > 95 = excellent quality). This enhanced the separation between defaulted and non-defaulted loan distributions.

* **Performance vs Practicality**:

  | Metric         | TensorFlow | XGBoost  |
  | -------------- | ---------- | -------- |
  | F1 Score       | **0.8185** | 0.6964   |
  | AUC-ROC        | **0.9657** | 0.9551   |
  | Training Speed | ❌ Slower   | ✅ Faster |
  | Explainability | ❌ Limited  | ✅ High   |

* **Efficiency**:
  XGBoost is significantly faster to train and tune, especially with cross-validation and large tabular data like this LendingClub dataset.

✅ **Summary**: XGBoost provided an ideal trade-off between predictive strength, model interpretability, scoring calibration, and speed — making it the optimal choice for production scoring.

## 📈 **Probability Scoring and Calibration Workflow**

### 1️⃣ Initial Probability Prediction
After training the **XGBoost** model, we generated *raw default probabilities* using:

```python
default_probs = model_xgb.predict_proba(X_scaled)[:, 1]
```
To create a more intuitive scoring scale, these probabilities were inverted (since *higher probability = higher risk*) and scaled to a **0–100 Asset Quality Score**:

✅ **Outcome:**
* Each loan received a continuous score between 0 (worst quality, highest risk) and 100 (best quality, lowest risk).
* **Observation:**
  The model was **underconfident**—even genuinely high-risk loans often received mid-range scores rather than very low ones, as visible in the first graph.
---

### 2️⃣ Probability Calibration
To correct this underconfidence and improve the reliability of the scores, we applied **Isotonic Regression calibration**:

  * It is non-parametric and can flexibly map predicted probabilities to observed frequencies without assuming a logistic shape.
  * Improves how well predicted probabilities align with actual default rates.

* Recomputed the asset scores:
  The second density plot showed **better separation**: Defaulted loans were much more concentrated in the lowest deciles.
---

### 3️⃣ Decile Binning

To further simplify interpretation, the calibrated scores were divided into **10 deciles**:

* **Decile 1** = worst 10% of loans by predicted quality.
* **Decile 10** = best 10%.

### 4️⃣ Assigning Integer Scores and Grades

To create even simpler, business-friendly labels:

* **Integer Asset Quality Score:** 1–10 (based on decile).
* **Grades:**

| Decile | Grade                 |
| ------ | --------------------- |
| 1      | E - Extremely Risky   |
| 2      | D - Risky             |
| 3–4    | C - Medium Quality    |
| 5–6    | B - Good Quality      |
| 7–10   | A - Excellent Quality |

### 5️⃣ Saving Final Outputs

The enriched dataset included:
* Raw calibrated probabilities
* Continuous 0–100 asset quality scores
* Integer decile scores
* Categorical grades

## 🧠 **Model Explainability**

**1️⃣ SHAP Analysis (Global Interpretability)**
* **Top Positive Contributors to Default Risk:**
  * Low `total_rec_prncp` (principal repaid)
  * Low `last_pymnt_amnt` (recent payment)
  * High `int_rate` (interest rate)
  * Poor `sub_grade` and `grade`
  * High `installment` amounts
* Features like `total_rec_late_fee` and `payment_burden` also contributed to increased risk.
* Colors in the summary plot:
  * **Red:** High feature values (e.g., high interest rate)
  * **Blue:** Low feature values
* The SHAP values show how each feature pushes the prediction towards default or non-default.


**2️⃣ LIME Analysis (Local Interpretability)**
* For a single observation (index `100`):

  * The prediction was **70% default probability**.
  * LIME identified the top features pushing the probability towards default (e.g., high `grade`, high `payment_burden`) and non-default (e.g., higher `last_pymnt_amnt`).
  * The LIME explanation was saved as an **interactive HTML file** for easy inspection.

#### ⚠️ Known Limitations
Data & Scope Limitations
* Absence of Macroeconomic Context: The model does not incorporate critical macroeconomic variables (GDP growth, unemployment rates, interest rate cycles, inflation) that significantly influence credit risk across economic cycles. This limits the model's ability to predict performance during economic downturns or expansions.
* Historical Lending Policy Bias: The model inherits biases from LendingClub's historical lending policies and approval criteria from 2007-2015, potentially perpetuating discriminatory practices against certain demographic groups. This may not reflect fair lending standards or current regulatory requirements.
* LendingClub-Specific Default Definitions: The model assumes LendingClub's specific definitions of default and loan status categories, which may not align with traditional banking definitions or regulatory standards used by other financial institutions.

Technical & Methodological Limitations
* Class Imbalance Sensitivity: Despite SMOTE application, the severe class imbalance (13.14% defaults) may lead to overoptimistic performance metrics and poor generalization to portfolios with different default rates.
* Model Calibration Challenges: Deep learning models showed overconfidence while XGBoost was underconfident, requiring extensive calibration. This calibration dependency may not hold across different time periods or loan populations.
* Limited Temporal Validation: The model lacks time-based validation across different economic cycles, potentially failing during market stress or changing economic conditions.
* Feature Engineering Subjectivity: Engineered features rely on domain assumptions and fixed weightings that may not generalize across different lending environments or borrower populations.

Validation & Generalization Issues
* Single-Platform Bias: Training exclusively on LendingClub data limits generalizability to traditional bank lending, different loan products, or alternative lending platforms.
* Lack of External Validation: The model has not been validated on external datasets or different financial institutions, raising concerns about out-of-sample performance and real-world applicability.
* Static Model Architecture: The model doesn't account for concept drift - changes in borrower behavior, lending standards, or economic conditions over time.

#### 🚀 Future Improvements
Enhanced Data Integration
* Macroeconomic Factor Incorporation: Integrate time-series macroeconomic indicators (GDP growth, unemployment, housing prices, consumer confidence) using time series analysis techniques like ARIMA models to improve predictions during economic cycles.
* Alternative Data Sources: Incorporate non-traditional data such as social media behavior, transaction patterns, utility payment history, and employment verification data to improve risk assessment accuracy.
* Real-Time Data Streaming: Implement dynamic updating mechanisms that continuously incorporate new loan performance data and borrower behavioral changes.

Advanced Modeling Techniques
* Time Series Classification Models: Implement Time Series Classification (TSC) algorithms that explicitly model the temporal aspects of loan performance, capturing payment patterns and behavioral evolution over time.
* Deep Learning Calibration Improvements: Develop better neural network calibration methods beyond Isotonic Regression, including temperature scaling, Platt scaling, and specialized calibration architectures for imbalanced datasets.
* Ensemble Meta-Learning: Create stacked ensemble models that combine predictions from multiple algorithms with learned meta-features, potentially improving both accuracy and calibration.

Model Validation & Robustness
* Cross-Portfolio Validation: Implement external validation frameworks using data from multiple lending institutions and loan types to ensure model generalizability.
* Stress Testing Integration: Develop scenario-based stress testing capabilities that evaluate model performance under various economic conditions and market shocks.
* Fairness-Aware Modeling: Implement bias detection and mitigation techniques to ensure fair lending compliance and reduce discriminatory outcomes across demographic groups.

Operational Enhancements
* Model Monitoring & Drift Detection: Establish automated model performance monitoring with drift detection capabilities to identify when retraining is necessary.
* Explainability Standardization: Develop standardized explanation frameworks that provide consistent, regulation-compliant justifications for lending decisions across different stakeholder needs.
* Multi-Horizon Prediction: Extend the model to provide risk predictions across multiple time horizons (6-month, 1-year, 3-year) rather than single-point estimates.
* Integration with Loan Pricing: Develop Risk-Adjusted Return on Capital (RAROC) integration to directly connect asset quality scores with optimal loan pricing and portfolio management strategies.
